## Binary Classification
Binary Classification of the butterfly images belonging to groups ADONIS and GREEN CELLED CATTLEHEART.<br>
The model so implemented is <b>Logistic Regression</b> and in vectorized form <br> 
Mapping <i>ADONIS</i> to 1 and <i>GREEN CELLED CATTLEHEART</i> to 0 <br>
We have the images in <b>train_move</b> and <b>test_move</b> <br>
# train_move
consists about 176 images which are used to train the model <br>
# test_move 
consists about 10 images which are used to testify the model <br>
Here we are not following the seggregation rules <br>
## Steps to run :
  1. Install pandas, numpy and cv to your python environment
  2. Run Preprocessing_Data.ipynb to generate a training set named as train_176_images.csv
  3. Run the BinaryClassification.ipynb to train the module
  You can save the parameters and can use them in your projects.
